# Data Mining
A brief introduction to the use of R to mine data, leverage machine learning algorithims, and derive insight. Most of these projects will follow the methodology described in ["Machine Learning with R - Second Edition"](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/machine-learning-r-second-edition) and will be completed in R.
